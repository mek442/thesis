In this paper, we present a novel approach to prioritizing performance test cases according to a code commit's performance impact on them. With our approach, developers can execute most-affected test cases earlier and for more times to confirm a performance regression. Our evaluation results show that our approach is able to achieve large improvement over three baseline approaches, and to cover top 3 most-performance-affected test cases within 37\% and 30\% test cases on Apache Commons Math and Xalan, respectively. 

%To further enhance our approach, we plan to work on the following directions in future. First, we plan to evaluate our approach on more subjects and code commits, especially software of different programming languages or with frequent and large commits. Secondly, we plan to develop techniques for more accurate estimation of execution time considering method inputs as factors. Thirdly, we plan to extend our performance model for multi-thread software. Fourth, we plan to perform user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our metrics in real world settings.
