\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed an approach to automatically identifying security bug reports based on term ranking, classification as well as bootstrapping. We constructed a data set with labelled security bug reports from the RedHat bug repository, and evaluated our approach on the data set. The experimental results show that our approach achieves higher than 86\% on both recall and F-score, and our approach outperforms the best baseline approaches (standard classification, and term ranking) by 8.3 to 9.9 percentage points on F-score. In the future, we plan to evaluate our approach on more data sets to check whether our conclusion is general. Furthermore, we plan to consider features on top of single terms, such as bi-grams or mined knowledge from other bug reports or artifacts of the software project.
