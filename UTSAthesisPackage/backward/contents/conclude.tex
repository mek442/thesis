\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present a study on behavioral backward incompatibilities based on regression testing of 68 version pairs of 15 Java software libraries, and inspection of 126 real world bugs. From our study, we find that behavioral backward incompatibilities are prevalent among Java software libraries, and caused most of real-world backward-incompatibility bugs. Furthermore, many of the behavioral backward incompatibilities are intentional, but are rarely well documented. We also categorized behavioral backward incompatibilities according to incompatible behaviors and invocation conditions, and found category mismatches between the the BBIs detected in regression testing and the BBIs causing bugs. 

%Finally, we found that most BBI-related bugs are fixed by client developers with relatively simple patches.
